# Nand2Tetris Project Review

## Overview
This repository marks the beginning of a collaborative project to study and work through the book **"The Elements of Computing Systems"** by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. The book, together with its accompanying course, guides readers in building a computer system from the ground up — from logic gates to a full operating system.

Our goal is to:
- Review the concepts presented in the book.
- Implement the exercises and projects step by step.
- Document our progress and insights as a team.

## Collaboration
The repository will be organized into branches, one for each participant.  
- Each participant will develop solutions to the exercises in their own branch.  
- We will use pull requests and code reviews to share, compare, and refine our work.  
- Collaboration will emphasize learning, experimentation, and constructive feedback.

## Resources
We will rely on:
- The official book: *The Elements of Computing Systems*  
- The authors’ website and course materials: [nand2tetris.org](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)  
- Additional references and tools provided by the course.

## Participants
This project is a joint effort by three collaborators, each contributing their perspective and solutions. Branches will be named accordingly to reflect individual contributions.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org-or-user>/<repo-name>.git
